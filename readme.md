# Advanced Git Workshop

## Learning Objectives

- Identify what the HEAD in git is.
- Use `git checkout` to inspect git SHA-1 instead of branches
- Define detached HEAD state
- Use bisection (`git bisect`) to indentify potentially bad commits.
- Determine relationships between commits
- Identify how `~` and `^` characters are used to leverage commit relationships
- Describe the three trees of git
- Reset git history
